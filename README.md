# Run the code in 60 seconds

In this section, we will run the oracle baseline on the devset. This will give an idea of the simulator and code 
and does not require tensorflow.

Supports: Mac and Linux Build

Instructions for running on Mac:

1) Clone the code  ``git clone https://github.com/clic-lab/blocks``
2) Go to blocks/BlockWorldSimulator/ and run build_mac.app
   Choose the Fastest mode setting and any resolution (does not matter which resolution).
3) Now run the oracle baseline. Go to BlockWorldRoboticAgent and run the following command:
     
      ``python agent_oracle.py``

** Stable Release and pre-trained models coming soon ...**
